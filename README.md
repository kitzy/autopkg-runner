# Autopkg GitHub Runner

This repository is an adaptation of [Betsy Keiser's `autopkg-gh-runner`](https://github.com/betsykeiser/autopkg-gh-runner). I made a number of tweaks so that it works in my specific environment, which means the files here may require further adjustments to run elsewhere. If you're searching for a general starting point, use Betsy's original project and treat this repo as a reference for environment‑specific modifications.
